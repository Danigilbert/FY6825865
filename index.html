 Cybersecurity is becoming greater awareness in the manufacturing, healthcare, energy, and other industries.  
 Despite this, The number of cyber attacks is getting alarmingly bigger. 
 In fact, it is predicted that cybercrime damage to enterprises and businesses 
 could reach up to $10.5 trillion USD annually by 2025, up from $3 trillion USD in 2015. 
 In short, cybercrime has come a long way from 5 bitcoins 
 (worth 2000$ at the time) that were asked from the individual 
 who hacked nearly 165 million LinkedIn accounts in 2016. 
 Now, highly sophisticated hacker groups sponsored by countries like China, 
 Russia and North Korea are tearing holes into the Western economy with 
 nearly 60% of businesses that suffer a breach going completely bankrupt. 
 Now you know the risks, the question is How do you deal with such a threat? 
 The most effective solution is actually a niche sub-section of cybersecurity.
