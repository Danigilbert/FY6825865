        <h2> What is Cyber Deception? </h2>

        <p> Cyber deception is exactly what it says it is, however a common misconception from people who aren’t in the know about IT security is believing it to be another term for a Honey pot. Although they share some similarities, it's essential to clarify the distinctions between the two.
In more practical terms, a honeypot can take on various forms, acting as a lure to attract and trap undesired invaders. The very name implies its goal: to entice and ensnare, enabling observation and potential intervention ("What's the Real Difference Between Cyber Deception and Honeypots?"). On the flip side, cyber deception environments leverage honeypots to draw attackers into an almost entirely undetectable fake network, setting the stage to trap the hacker. 
Cyber deception on the other hand creates digital environments that look and feel like the real thing and are orchestrated by a team to help the attacker progress through the fake network, while they collect information, and learn more about trends in breach methods and behavior. You can almost compare the relationship between honey pots and cyber deception to the breach of Troy. As effective as the horse (honeypot) was at deceiving the Trojans, the attacker, it's ultimately the plan of attack, the deception environment, that allowed the Greeks to conquer the walled city. 
But what does that process actually look like in real time? How do deception environments transform attackers into unwitting test monkeys for threat intelligence officers? Attackers typically pinpoint a target based on their overarching goals. For those aiming to wreak havoc on the Western economy, small to medium-sized businesses become the focus—either for stealing information or, more commonly, demanding a ransom payout. If the agenda leans towards making a political statement, large corporations become their no.1 objective. As mentioned in the introduction, however, attackers will target pretty much any industry for some malicious motivation. Higher education institutions in particular  are more severely affected. Six in ten of the higher education institutions are reported to have experienced breaches or attacks that report losing money or data or having compromised accounts used for illicit purposes as a result. (“Cyber security breaches survey 2023: education institutions annex”)
Once attackers set their sights, they attempt to breach basic surface-level data, believing they've hit the jackpot if their target employs cyber deception. Over time, they uncover more data within the deception environment. When there's nothing of perceived importance left to feed them, the decision to pull the plug rests with those orchestrating the cyber deception. It all boils down to this in the realm of deception. 

Now, amidst the complexity lies the coding element of a deception environment. However, in the grand scheme of things, the process bears resemblance to historical strategic maneuvers—akin to the intricacies of Operation Fortitude in WW2.
