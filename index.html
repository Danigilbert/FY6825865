        Cybersecurity is becoming of greater awareness in the manufacturing, healthcare, energy, and other industries.
        Despite this, the number of cyber attacks is growing alarmingly. In fact, it is predicted that cybercrime damage to enterprises and businesses could reach up to $10.5 trillion USD annually by 2025, up from $3 trillion USD in 2015. In short, cybercrime has come a long way from 5 bitcoins (worth $2,000 at the time) that were asked from the individual who hacked nearly 165 million LinkedIn accounts in 2016. Now, highly sophisticated hacker groups sponsored by countries like China, Russia, and North Korea are tearing holes into the Western economy, with nearly 60% of businesses that suffer a breach going completely bankrupt. Now you know the risks, the question is how do you deal with such a threat? The most effective solution is actually a niche sub-section of cybersecurity. It is called <b>CyberDeception</b>
