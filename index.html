        <h2> Abstract </h2>
<p>In the $200 billion cybersecurity industry, the surge in cyber threats demands innovative solutions. This article assesses current vulnerabilities across industries, government, and businesses, which can all be exemplified by the recent cyberattacks on the Dallas city council, as well as other events. It critiques the lack of time-intensive nature of current threat intelligence technology, and introduces Cyber Deception, a method of security inspired by historical military tactics. This is a much swifter protocol that involves detecting, delaying, and disorienting attackers in fake environments and is proving to be better than other conventional methods.
</p>
        <p> Delving into Cyber Deception, the article unveils deception environments, surpassing traditional honeypots. By strategically bluffing attackers with fake data, managers gain time to fortify real security systems. Emphasizing adaptability, the article highlights the proactive stance of the UK and US governments in adopting deception tactics. As a responsive and effective threat intelligence tool, Cyber Deception is one of the best cybersecurity tools to have in any business’s/government/industry’s arsenal. </p>

    <div id="Introduction">

        <h2> Introduction </h2>
<p> In the rapidly evolving $200 billion cybersecurity industry ("Cyber Security Market Size, Share & Trends Report, 2030"), the perpetual struggle to outpace the always-increasing skill of modern hacker groups remains the same. Despite heightened global awareness, IT security companies face relentless pressure as solutions are circumvented, strongly encouraging constant adaptation. The threat landscape's sophistication causes concerns, with ransomware damages projected to reach $22 trillion annually by 2027 (Fleck). This convergence of technological advancement, persistent threats, and escalating economic consequences highlights the critical need to address cybersecurity challenges, as even year-old solutions risk becoming obsolete in this competitive environment.

<h2>Main body. </h2>
<p> No industry is immune to these threats; ranging from healthcare to construction to banking. The financial losses incurred by corporations are often incomprehensible, sometimes even leading to significant employee layoffs. A recent illustration of this in business was the moveIT security breach, which is estimated to cost $6.5 billion in repairs and exposed critical data, impacting nearly 200 companies that used the same file management software (Kapko).</p>

<p>In May of 2023, Dallas experienced a major ransomware breach by the hacker group ‘Royal’ who had been patrolling the servers since April. This didn't just leave the constituents of the city council exposed, but Dallas entirely, with vast power grid shutdowns, complete water cuts, and even a temporary blackout on emergency services. The consequences of the cyberattack for the Dallas city council included 8.5 million in repairs and an intense collective time of 39950 man-hours to remediate the compromised system to a highly secure and functioning network(“THE CITY OF DALLAS RANSOMWARE INCIDENT: MAY 2023”).

<p> But perhaps one of the more concerning examples of a cyberattack on infrastructure is the attempted poisoning of the Florida water supply in 2021. Without warning, hackers breached the computer system operating the plant on Feb. 5, with the ambition of boosting treatment chemical levels of lye from the usual 100 parts per million to a highly toxic 11,100 parts per million(Warren). Luckily, a vigilant employee saw this and prevented this disaster from taking place, however, the event demonstrated the danger of using tired security setups for critical infrastructure(Kardon).

<p> In light of such threats, many corporations are adopting proactive measures like threat intelligence. This is a technique that involves monitoring behaviour and activity of the attacker. This can provide useful data and pointers which will be used to further reinforce a business’ network. Although it is the best form of network security, for most of the common threat intelligence software, typical intell turnaround takes on average nearly 4 weeks, with some even taking months. This timeframe cannot keep up with attackers who can break into a company's networks in less than 90 mins(Baker). 

<p> Cyber-Deception however, the latest trend in threat intelligence whose methods bear remarkable similarities to historical military subterfuge tactics used by Napoleon Bonaparte, emerges as a beacon of hope, where even in the face of potential vulnerabilities in a network, can detect, delay and disorient an attacker as soon as an intruder makes an attempt on the system. 


<p>Originally, the idea of Cyber Deception came in the form of something called a honey pot. In more practical terms, a honeypot can take on various forms, acting as a lure to attract and trap undesired invaders. The very name implies its goal: to entice and ensnare, enabling observation and potential intervention ("What's the Real Difference Between Cyber Deception and Honeypots?"). They have been the oldest form of deception however by modern standards, they are surface level compared to the complexity of a deception environment. 
Cyber Deception environments therefore leverage honeypots, as well as other deceptive elements like replica behaviours of a user on the network, and Bogus employee credentials to draw attackers into an almost entirely undetectable fake network, setting the stage to trap the intruders. Unlike traditional security infrastructure, deception technology does not seek to defend the network perimeter, rather it uncovers any adversary activity (what the hacker is doing inside the fake network), even if it comes from within an organization(CounterCraft).</p> 
<p>Like Texas Hold'em Poker, the objective of the environment is to bluff the attacker into thinking the cards are in his favour, by drip-feeding him seemingly crucial data as if it were real until all the chips of information are placed on the table and the game is called (Reynolds et al.). The big advantage is whatever information or “chips” the attacker wins is just fake information and any chips that the operators of the environment win is helpful data.  
This gives the managers of the deception environment time to not only collect valuable intel on the behaviour of the attackers which we can use to further enhance the realness of the environment, but also set up our other security systems to meet the standard that our attacker is presenting.
